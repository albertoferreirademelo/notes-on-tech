    <h1>About Alberto</h1>
    <p>
      I work across data, design, and public service — exploring how AI can be transparent, humane, and useful for everyday
      problems. Sweden is home now, and the pace here shapes how I build things: calm, deliberate, experimental.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site is a working notebook. I publish notes in English and Swedish, document side projects, and map ideas before they
      become polished. The goal is to share process, not polish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work you’ll find me learning new tools, photographing quiet city corners, or prototyping with 3D printers and
      tiny microcontrollers.

    <h1>About Alberto</h1>
      <p>
        I work at the intersection of data, design and public service.  
        My focus is on making AI transparent, humane and genuinely useful.  
        Sweden is home now, and Brazil will always be the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is my working notebook.  
        I write in English and Swedish, document side projects  
        and share ideas before they are fully formed.  
        The goal is to show process, not polish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work I like to explore new tools, photograph  
        and experiment with 3D printing and small electronics.  
        Curiosity connects it all.

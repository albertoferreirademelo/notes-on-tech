      <h1>About Alberto</h1>
      <p>
        I work at the intersection of data, design, and public service — helping shape how AI can be used responsibly and with purpose. Based in Sweden, I spend most of my days building analytical tools and exploring how technology can serve people, not the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is a place to think out loud — part lab, part journal. You’ll find notes on AI, data visualization, and digital ethics, mixed with a few side projects and experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I like to tinker: coding, photographing, 3D printing, and occasionally breaking things to see how they work.

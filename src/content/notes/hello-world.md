### Welcome and thanks for stopping by!

This site is my small corner of the internet. No dashboards, no pop-ups, no noise. Just markdown, curiosity, and the occasional cup of coffee.

### Why did I create this blog

I work with AI and data every day and wanted a place to share experiments, prompts, and reflections in a slower format. I also have thousands of ideas that deserve a home outside sticky notes.

### What you’ll find here

Notes on data, AI, and design, mixed with experiments, side projects, and a few thoughts from everyday life. Some posts will be technical, others just reflections on life.

Thanks for reading. Let’s see where this goes.

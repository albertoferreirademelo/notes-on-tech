Welcome to **Notes on Tech, AI, and Life in Sweden**.

This site is intentionally light and handcrafted. No dashboards, no complex CMS — just markdown files, a curious mind,
and a warm cup of coffee.

## Why warm tech?

I believe technology can feel welcoming. Something you’re glad to return to. Warm tech is thoughtful about pacing,
friction, and the humans on the other side of the screen.

## What to expect

- Short essays about machine intelligence and creative tooling.
- Experiments with prototypes, sensors, and analog workflows.
- Observations from everyday Swedish life.

Thanks for reading — more soon.

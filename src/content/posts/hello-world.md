### Welcome — and thanks for stopping by.

This site is my small corner of the internet. No dashboards, no pop-ups, no noise. Just markdown, curiosity, and the occasional cup of coffee.

### Why did I create this blog

I work with AI and data every day, and I always think that it would be great to help people on their AI journey and also how can I make AI more human?  
I also have thousands ideas and projects that would be fun to share.

### What you’ll find here

Notes on data, AI, and design, mixed with experiments, side projects, and a few thoughts from everyday life.  
Some posts will be technical, others just reflections on life.

Thanks for reading. Let’s see where this goes.

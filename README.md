It’s a mix of notes, small experiments, and occasional essays.

- **Styling:** Custom dark theme (no UI library)
- **Content:** Markdown files powered by [Astro Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/)
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages → soon moving to [ferreirademelo.com](https://ferreirademelo.com)
